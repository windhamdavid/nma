					<p><strong>CRIMINAL LAW</strong>
					<p><strong>Criminal Defense</strong> - Nicholson, Meredith and Anderson, LLC has experience   defending the rights of people arrested and accused of criminal offenses. Our   firm handles all types of criminal cases, from minor infractions and   misdemeanors, such as traffic violations, to the most serious felony   indictments. W.H. Nicholson, III was previously Chief Public Defender for   Abbeville and Greenwood Counties during 1987 and 1988.

					<p><strong>DUI / DUS</strong>-Traffic violations can have serious criminal   consequences, particularly when a driver is accused of driving under the   influence. A conviction on DUI / DWI charges may result in fines, the revocation   or suspension of your driver's license, and possible jail time. In addition,   your insurance company may increase your rates to an unmanageable level. In   defending against an impaired driving charge, you have many rights as a criminal   defendant, including the right to cross-examine the witnesses against you, even   if they are police officers.

					<p><strong>FAMILY LAW</strong>
					<p>Few legal areas are as emotionally charged as family law, primarily for the   litigants, but also for the lawyers and judges involved in the cases and even   the public at large. In divorce and child custody cases in particular, the   adversarial process has increased tensions between the parties that do not abate   even when the process is complete. As a result, many states have begun to   explore other, non-adversarial alternatives, such as mandatory mediation, which   can save time and money and preserve relationships to the extent possible.   Mediation and other Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) processes provide an   option for those who prefer to stay out of court. ADR provides many potential   advantages for most cases, including reduced cost, faster resolution, less   emotional stress, the ability to construct solutions that are outside of the   authority of the courts.</p>
					<p>Nicholson, Meredith and Anderson, LLC assists clients in all aspects of the law relating   to the needs of today's families, including, but not limited to:</p>

					<ul>
